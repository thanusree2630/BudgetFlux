# BudgetFlux

**BudgetFlux** is a full-stack **expense management system** built with **FastAPI** for a high-performance backend, **Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly frontend, and a **SQL database** for secure, persistent data storage.

It is designed to make expense tracking fast, simple, and insightful â€” allowing users to log expenses, categorize them, and review analytics by category and month.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **frontend/**: Houses the Streamlit application code for the interactive user interface.
- **backend/**: Contains the FastAPI server code for handling API requests and data processing.
- **tests/**: Includes test cases to ensure the reliability of both frontend and backend components.
- **images/**: Stores images used in the README (e.g., screenshots).
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all necessary Python dependencies for the project.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and setup instructions.
